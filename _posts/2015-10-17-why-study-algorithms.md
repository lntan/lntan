## Why study algorithms?

### Their impact is broad and far-reaching

- Database system architecture
- Operating system kernel
- Computer graphics
- Social network analysis
- Parallel computing and distributed systems

###  To become a proficient programmer

> _\"I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important._
> _Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.\"_ - Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux)


> _\" Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs. \"_ - Niklaus Wirth


### No magic

We easily deep into programing languages, frameworks, even into operating system implementation for performance optimization and customization.
